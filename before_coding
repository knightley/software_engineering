Abstract:
All business logic should be abstract enough.  Don’t use too specific variable name and function name and class name.

Debuggability: log, trace. log, trace should not influence business logic, should have blank line between log, trace and business logic

Testability: error handling, test coverage(if... else… cover 80%), test case(good or bad)
